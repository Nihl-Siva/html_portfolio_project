                                I grew up in Waterloo Iowa, and currently reside in Cedar Rapids with my 
                                roommate, his  corgi Ein, and my cat Freyja. After graduating high school I attended the 
                                University of Iowa, and received my bachelors degree in psychology, sociology and criminology. 
                                While in school I worked as an IT specialist providing technical support to students and 
                                instructors. During that time and after graduating I worked in a pizza parlor for almost 
                                10 years, until COVID. At that time I moved back home to Waterloo to help out at my dad’s 
                                recording studio where I worked until recently starting a coding program.

                                In the meantime, I’ve been working for an app startup founded by a friend from college called 
                                Daytz. If you’d like to learn more about that or see the web page I built for us check out the

                        <p>I’ve always liked messing with computers. I built my first gaming rig in high school, 
                            but I’ve been fixing computers and entertainment systems since I was about 8 years old. 
                            I really enjoy the way coding feels like a puzzle to be deciphered and solved.

                            Quarantine admittedly made very jealous of my programmer friends remote jobs, and the 
                            flexibility in the schedule and workspace would allow me to keep playing music and touring. 
                            It will also be beneficial for my work on the app startup I’m a part of to be able to work on the 
                            development, or at minimum speak more intelligently with our programming team. </p>
